= Streetfighting

[? if rb_banned = 0: Battles rage on the streets between the Nazi SA, nationalist Stahlhelm, communist Rotfrontkämpferbund (RFB), and our own Reichsbanner. ?] [? if rb_banned = 0: Battles rage on the streets between the Nazi SA, nationalist Stahlhelm, and communist Rotfrontkämpferbund (RFB). Our own Reichbanner was banned and is no longer a part of this fight. ?] In some parts of the country, conditions are nearing civil war levels, as dozens of people are killed each month.

We must do something to protect the workers against these predations.

- @test_battle: Test our defense units in battle against the fascists!
- @break_sa_rally: Send our strongest units to disrupt Nazi rallies!
- @arm_rb: Increase training and armaments for the Reichsbanner.
- @if_training: Train union members to fight as part of the Iron Front.
- @prussian_police_training: Use the Prussian police to help train the Reichsbanner.
- @military_training: Use our military connections to covertly arm the Reichsbanner.
- @peace: Try to avoid all militant confrontations, as much as possible.
- @truce_rfb: Try to make peace with the RFB.

Many Reichsbanner members are not ready for actual fighting, and thus quit. However, the remainder are toughened as a result. Our confrontations also provide ample recruiting material for the Nazi SA.

go-to: break_rally_fail if our_strength < enemy_strength; break_rally_succeed if our_strength >= enemy_strength

Our street troops disrupt a NSDAP rally to prevent the Nazis from meeting. The SA goons immediately wade into the fray. [? if spd_prussia: The police attempts to hold the two groups apart, with great resentment and little success. ?] [? if (not spd_prussia): The police has been deployed against the Reichsbanner. ?] 

@break_rally_fail
on-arrival: workers_nsdap += 3; old_middle_nsdap += 1; new_middle_nsdap += 1; unemployed_nsdap += 1; rb_strength -= 50; sa_strength += 50

Unfortunately, the Reichsbanner was not able to overcome the SA mob. The Nazi meeting goes ahead as usual.

@break_rally_succeed
on_arrival: workers_nsdap -= 3; workers_spd += 3; sa_strength -= 20

Our disruption is successful! The Nazis are cowed by our show of strength and flee the scene.

on-arrival: resources -= rb_militarization_cost; rb_militancy += 0.06; rb_strength += 50; sa_strength += 50; z_relation -= 5 if historical_mode 

We have increased training and purchased more armaments for the Reichsbanner.

[? if historical_mode : The Center Party decries the militarization of the Reichsbanner, and its members are leaving the republican organization. ?]

As part of the Iron Front, we are increasing coordination between the Reichsbanner and the unions, and many union members want to become more involved.

@prussian_police_training
view-if: spd_prussia == 1 and prussian_police_loyalty > 0.5 and rb_banned = 0
on-arrival: rb_militancy += (0.1*(prussian_police_loyalty)); sa_strength += 50; police_rb_train += 1; police_rb_team = 1; police_militancy += 0.05

The Reichsbanner and the loyal sections of the Prussian police are learning to effectively fight alongside each other.

Some of the military equipment [? if military_rearmed >= 1: from the ongoing rearmament ?][? if military_rearmed < 1: left over from the last war ?] has inexplicably vanished from Reichswehr storehouses and ended up in the hands of our activists. While our loyalists in Reichswehr turn a blind eye, everyone else decries our corruption and abuse of power.

view-if: rb_banned = 0
on-arrival: rb_militancy -= 0.02; rb_strength -= 50; pacifism += 1; neorevisionist_dissent += 8; neorevisionist_strength -= 8

By not fighting, the strength of the Reichsbanner atrophies. Pacifists in the party are gaining the upper hand.

@truce_rfb
choose-if: kpd_relation >= 45
view-if: kpd_truce == 0 and rb_banned = 0
unavailable-subtitle: The KPD is not interested.
on-arrival: kpd_truce = 1; kpd_relation += 5; rfb_strength += 50; rb_strength += 50; sa_strength += 50;

We have made at least a temporary truce with the KPD, so that our respective paramilitaries will stop fighting.

@teamwork_rfb
choose-if: kpd_relation >= 55
view-if: kpd_truce == 1 and rfd_rb_team == 0 and rb_banned = 0

on-arrival: rfd_rb_team = 1; kpd_relation += 5; rfb_strength += 50; rb_strength += 50; sa_strength += 50;
max-visits: 2

We are coordinating with the KPD, so that our respective paramilitaries can occasionally fight alongside each other in the future.

With the Reichsbanner banned, there is little we can do to stop the Nazis from killing us, our friends and our families.
