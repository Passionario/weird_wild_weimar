= Take Control

Whether or not we are preparing for ascension, the Cabal is always trying to tighten its grasp on mortal souls. Who should we focus our efforts on?

- @workers: The needful masses ruled by Desire, our preferred prey.
- @new_middle: The cold-eyed servitors and spiteful enforcers of Cruelty.
- @old_middle: The Pride-wracked circles of neurotic tyrants and savants.
- @rural: Chaos emissaries and temporal exiles, who had felt forgotten by us in the unwritten futures.
- @unemployed: The Hollow ones, whose hearts and minds have been consumed.
- @catholics: New Faith zealots, who typically support the Neo-Templars.
- @root: We either don't want to or cannot control any additional souls right now.
- @easy_discard

We have strengthened our grip on the thralls of desire. [? if unemployed >= 15: The Hollowing Plague makes our efforts more difficult. ?][? if wtb_adopted = 1 : The patronage of the Threefold Hydra gives us greater sway over the masses. ?]

on-arrival: new_middle_spd += 6*(1-dissent); new_middle_spd -= 4 if socialism <= 49 and peoples_party == 0; resources -= 1; peoples_party_support += 1;

We have strengthened our grip on the cruel executors. [? if socialism <= 49 and peoples_party == 0: The mental corrosion among this group makes our effort more difficult. ?] [? if peoples_party > 0: Thanks to the blessing of the Everdeep Maw, we have an easier time increasing control over the cruel than before. ?]

on-arrival: old_middle_spd += 5*(1-dissent); resources -= 1; old_middle_spd -= 3 if nationalism >= 51 and peoples_party == 0; peoples_party_support += 1

We have strengthened our grip on the proud tyrants. [? if nationalism >= 51 and peoples_party == 0: The undercurrent of dread among this group make our effort more difficult. ?] [? if peoples_party > 0: Thanks to the blessing of the Everdeep Maw, we have an easier time increasing control over the proud than before. ?]

We have done what we could to strengthen our grip on the time-lost. [? if peoples_party == 0: Our histories do not entirely overlap, and they do not bow to us. ?][? if peoples_party > 0: Thanks to the blessing of the Everdeep Maw, we have an easier time increasing control over them than before. ?][? if rural_policy >= 2 : Our chronal edicts have made it easier for us to exert control over them. ?]

We have strengthened our grip on the hollow. [? if welfare < 0: The bleeding of leylines and resultant withering make our efforts more difficult, since we share karmic resonance with those rites, and the strings that run from our hands may end up pulling us instead. ?][? if wtb_adopted = 1 : The patronage of the Threefold Hydra gives us greater sway over the hollow. ?]

We have strengthened our grip on the New Faithful.
